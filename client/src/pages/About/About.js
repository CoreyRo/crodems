                                    <p>Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how things work and technology in general. I
                                        loved to take things apart to see if I could put them back together again.</p>
                                    <p>I remember the first computer my parents had. It was an Apple with a clunky
                                        CRT monitor and noisy hardware. While the stock games were fun, I really wanted
                                        to know how it worked. I discovered the settings option, and everything changed.
                                        I changed EVERYTHING you could customize. New backgrounds, mouse pointers,
                                        system sounds, and so on. Of course, my parents were annoyed that whenever they
                                        turned on the computer everything was different, but I was already hooked.</p>
                                    <p>I loved computer games and online communities. I made my first site in middle
                                        school using some GeoCities template. I played around with html and QBasic even
                                        though most of it was over my head back then, but I liked the challenge.
                                        Technology is always interesting and always advancing and the challenge to keep
                                        up with it is what drives my passion for tech.</p>
